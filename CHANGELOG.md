# Changelog

## 3.6.0 - 4 May 2021

### Security

- Fix for XSS and Electron reverse shell vulnerabilities by sanitizing `exiftool` HTML output in the UI. To take advantage of this, an attacker would have had to write image metadata containing malicious script code to a file that you then download and run through ExifCleaner. Proofs of concept:

XSS:

```bash
exiftool -Comment='<img src=x onerror=alert("ok") /><b>OverJT</b>' -PixelUnits='meters' image.png
```

Electron reverse shell:

```bash
exiftool -Comment='<img src=x onerror=window.require("child_process").exec("/usr/bin/firefox") /><b>OverJT</b>' -PixelUnits='meters' image.png
```

## 3.5.1 - 1 May 2021

## 3.5.0 - 1 May 2021

If you are running a previous version of ExifCleaner, update immediately due to a security vulnerability found in exiftool (the command-line tool that ExifCleaner uses under the hood). Thank you to all contributors for this release. As always, credits are listed in the README.
